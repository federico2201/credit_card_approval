# credit_card_approval
Build a ML model to predict credit card approval in a bank

Commercial banks process numerous credit card applications and often need to reject them. In this project, we'll use supervised machine learning techniques to automate this process, making it an efficient and cost-effective solution for banks.

The goal is to use supervised learning techniques to automate the credit card approval process for banks.

We'll preproccess the data and apply supervised learning techniques to find the best model and parameters for the job. We'll save the accuracy score from the best model as a numeric variable, best_score. We'll aim for an accuracy score of at least 0.75. The target variable is the last column of the DataFrame.
